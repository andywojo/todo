todo 
================================
todo is a lightweight ruby to-do system. 

The inspiration for writing this was simple:

*  I want something very easy and fast in my home directory to keep track of my day-to-day sysadmin tasks.
*  I didn't find anything lightweight out there already available.
*  I love ruby and want to keep learning.
